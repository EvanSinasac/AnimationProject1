ANIMATION
This project is to showcase keyframe animation.  As such, I have made several animations using the different kinds of keyframes we have done in class (position, rotation and scale).  The AnimationSystem and KeyFrame stuff is the code we have been working on in class.  The colour of the animated models show what type of easing is being used for the animation.  For simplicity I kept the same type of easing for an entire animation sequence.  NoEasing: White, EaseIn: Red, EaseOut: Yellow, EaseInOut: Green.  Pressing the arrow keys cycle all the entities' animations, but only the spheres in the center have multiple animations.  This is just for simplicity (might add more during the recorded demo).
